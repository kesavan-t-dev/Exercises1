# UI Design 
   - I use the HTML and CSS for this task
   - In the begining i use the box model to adjust the margin and padding to look correctly
   - but it will not organize the code and also it is not a good practice so i re construct this entire form into flex based css styling for even space and good looking
   - finaly i understand the HTML and CSS flexbox and box model and other css property related to this !
